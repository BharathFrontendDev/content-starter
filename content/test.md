**The type of personal information we collect** 

Most of the data we collect is company data collected from publicly available sources such as Companies House. We may also collect and process the following information as a data processor on behalf of our partner client (‘Controller’) who wishes to obtain personal and company data from you:

- Personal identifiers, contacts, and characteristics (for example, name, address, device, location, contact details, and company appointments); and 
- ID and verification documents such as your passport, driving license, and utility bills. 

This information can, depending on what is requested and what you provide, include ‘special category’ data which is given more protection under data protection laws. Special category data is defined in Article 9 of the UK GDPR as personal data revealing:

- racial or ethnic origin
- political opinions
- religious or philosophical beliefs
- trade union membership
- genetic data
- biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person
- data concerning health
- data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation. 

**How we get the personal information and why we have it**

Most of the personal information we process is provided to us directly by you for the purposes of onboarding you on behalf of the Controller. We take steps to verify this data, as part of our Service. This verification involves collecting and sharing personal data with trusted third parties. This includes sources such as Companies House, adverse media suppliers, credit providers, PEPs, and sanctions verification providers.

We use the information that you have given us in order to provide the Detected service on behalf of and at the request of the Controller. We will then share this information with the Controller for the purposes of onboarding you via our Portal. 

Under the Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we act at the direction of the Controller who is responsible for your data. However, in using our service, we also ask for your consent by asking you to login to confirm you accept the terms of our EULA and Privacy Notice. You can remove your consent at any time. You can do this by contacting us using our details set out above. Please note that if you withdraw your consent, we will not be able to provide personal data to the Controller. In those circumstances, we will not have any liability to you or the Controller in respect of any implications of your withdrawing consent. If you withdraw consent, this will not affect information that has already been shared with the Controller. 

How we store your personal information Your information is securely stored within UK data centres. We only transfer personal data outside of the UK / EEA if there is a lawful safeguard in place as required under data protection laws. 

We keep personal data for the duration of our customer contract unless required by applicable law to keep it. We will then dispose of your information by deleting it and making it irretrievable

**Your data protection rights**

Under data protection law, you have rights including:

- Your right of access - You have the right to ask us for copies of your personal information. 
- Your right to rectification - You have the right to ask us to rectify personal information you think is inaccurate. You also have the right to ask us to complete information you think is incomplete. 
- Your right to erasure - You have the right to ask us to erase your personal information in certain circumstances. 
- Your right to restriction of processing - You have the right to ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information in certain circumstances. 
- Your right to object to processing - You have the right to object to the processing of your personal information in certain circumstances.
- Your right to data portability - You have the right to ask that we transfer the personal information you gave us to another organization, or you, in certain circumstances.
